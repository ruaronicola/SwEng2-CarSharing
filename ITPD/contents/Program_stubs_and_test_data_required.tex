\section{Drivers}
For the PowerEnJoy system integration tests we decided to use a bottom-up strategy, this approach requires drivers in order to simulate components and invoke methods on the under-integration component.

The required drivers are:
\begin{description}
	\item [Entity Bean Drivers: ] these drivers are used to invoke the methods exposed by the Entity Java Beans components in order to test their integration with the connected components
	\item [RouterDriver: ] this driver is used to invoke the methods exposed by the Router component in order to test its integration with the connected components
	\item [RideControllerDriver: ] this driver is used to invoke the methods exposed by the RideController component in order to test its integration with the connected components
	\item [ReservationControllerDriver: ] this driver is used to invoke the methods exposed by the ReservationController component in order to test its integration with the connected components
	\item [AuthenticationManagerDriver: ] this driver is used to invoke the methods exposed by the AuthenticationManager component in order to test its integration with the connected components
\end{description}

\section{Stub}
\begin{description}
	\item [Payment Handler Stub: ] the interactions with the Payment Handler must be tested using a stub in order to verify that all the calls performed over the provided API are correctly formed.
	\item [Notification Handler Stub: ] the interactions with the Notification Handler must be tested using a stub in order to verify that all the calls performed over the provided API are correctly formed.
\end{description}

\section{Data}
\begin{description}
	\item [DataBase: ] the Entity Java Beans components must be integrated with the DBMS, therefore a "Testing" DB with the same structure of the production's DB is needed. Such DataBase must have enough entries to allow extensive testing of the Enterprise Information System.
