\section{Arquillian}
Arquillian (\textit{arquillian.org}) is a flexible and portable integration testing framework designed specifically for JEE. It will be used to test the correct behaviour of the containers and their interaction with the system.

\section{JMeter}
JMeter (\textit{jmeter.apache.org}) is an open-source application developed and maintained by the Apache foundation. It is designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance: in this project it will be used to achieve system and non-functional requirements testing.


\section{JUnit}
JUnit (\textit{junit.org}) is probably the most common framework for Java unit testing. In this project, though, it will be used in combination with Arquillian and Mockito to achieve High-level and integration testing.

\section{Mockito}
Mockito (\textit{site.mockito.org}) is a clean, simple and well supported Java mocking framework. It will be used to verify the interactions between objects and to create stubs when a componet cannot be tested in isolation.

The PowerEnJoy application needs to be deployed on different machines. Precisely, two main machines are needed: one machine capable of running an instance of the GlassFish Server and one machine capable of running the DBMS.
