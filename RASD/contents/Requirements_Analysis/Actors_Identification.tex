\section{Guest}
A guest is a person that hasn't already registered to the system or an user that hasn't already log in. She can only proceed with a new registration or log in.
\section{User}
We believe that PowerEnJoy can be used by a wide range of people that need only to access the system for benefit. A person became an user after her registration to the system, when she provides her credentials and payment information. 
\\A tipical user is a person who want to easily move around in a social end eco-friendly way. Usually she uses the service only for short travels near the \glspl{charging station}.
\\Our scope is to create an easy-to-use and efficent system that make the users satisfied and willing to use PowerEnJoy.
