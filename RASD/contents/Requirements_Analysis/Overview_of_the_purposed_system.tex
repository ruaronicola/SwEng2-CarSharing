In this chapter the product and its requirements are described in order to provide a background for the "Requirements specification" part and make it easier to understand.

\section{Product perspective}
% Here we put the application into perspective with other related products, interfaces/communication means should be identified


\subsection{User interfaces} % aka "Ease of use"
\label{subsec:user_interfaces}
We want to build an immediate and minimal graphic interface, which can be understood at first sight also by inexperienced users. Pages will be user-friendly and the link between them will appear as a natural relationship.
The user should be able to interact with the system in three ways:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Web application}: is strongly cross-platform and then accessible from any device that can browse the web
	\item{Mobile application}: accessible from smartphones and mobile devices in order to guarantee portability and ease of use
	\item{On-Board computer}: accessible from the inside of any PowerEnjoy car, it must be extremely straightforward and let the user focus on the actual interaction
\end{itemize}
A common and friendly UI should be provided to create a sort of logical connection between the three different applications and make the user feel comfortable. 

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
The web application has no other hardware constraints despite the ones specified in subsection \ref{subsec: hw_constraints}, it should run on any device meeting such minimum requirements. Mobile application has to communicate with GPS, Antenna and WiFi modules in order to retrieve location and query the server, requirements easily met by any modern smartphone.
\\On-Board computers require a car with self-diagnostic and reporting capability.

\subsection{Software interfaces}
The web application should support devices running any modern browser while the mobile application will be developed and supported on iOS, Android and eventually WP. 
\\On-Board computer's application is device-specific and will then be designed based on the ad-hoc hardware, embedded OS and APIs.

\section{Product functions}
The system that we are to develop must let users register and then login in order to manage their account and actively access the service. The provided functionalities are clearly enumerated in section \ref{sec: proj_objectives} and here graphically described to ease the complete comprehension of the system.

\end{figure}

\section{User characteristics}
The application should target users with a valid driving license, being at least 18 and providing a secure payment method, which must be checked before any reservation.
\\Additional legal requirements might be necessary, especially if the service is intended to spread into foreign countries

\section{Constraints}

\subsection{Regulatory policies}
Users must allow the system to collect and use personal data according to a privacy policy: data such as personal details, payment methods, transactions and locations are stored and processed in order to provide a higher service quality.

\subsection{Hardware limitations}
\label{subsec: hw_constraints}
Hardware requirements are extremely different depending on the application that is being considered; in this document, though, the on-board computer's hardware won't be discussed.
The web application development demand two main hardware constraints: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Stable internet connection}
	\item{Modern(supported) web browser}
\end{itemize}
The mobile application will be deployed for mobile devices, so even the memory constraints are consistents:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{ARM architecture}
	\item{At least 1GB of RAM}
	\item{At least 50MB of available storage}
	\item{Up-to-date operating system (minimum API level or OS version)} 
	\item{Stable internet connection}
	\item{GPS module may be useful but not necessary to access the service}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallel operation}
The system must support heavy parallel processing because of the high number of users that are to access the service potentially at the same time.

\subsection{Reliability requirements}
The system has to be supported by an Internet connection that reliably depends by our provider.  
\\It should be permitted to have little stops for maintenance. If occasionally the system has an unexpected stop however it can be accepted as the system doesn't cover a critical function. 

\section{Assumptions and dependencies}
In order for the system to work properly some domain assumptions are needed:%Maybe to check the order
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Sensors and devices needed to support the functionalities of the system are already installed on vehicles}
	\item{The system knows the battery level, location and number of passengers in each car}
	\item{Cars are equipped with a standard diagnostic connector and are using OBD-II communication protocols}
	\item{The GPS signal is sufficiently accurate ($\pm5m$ accuracy with A-GPS)}
	\item{All the vehicles are insured}
	\item{PowerEnJoy runs only one type of vehicle}
	\item{The battery level always refers to the full-charge}

	\item{All other functions are locked while reserving a vehicle}
	\item{Users driving licenses are checked}
	\item{The vehicle is driven by the user that reserved it}
	\item{If a vehicle is damaged during the ride the user is responsible for it}
	\item{If a vehicle is charging it's in a charging station}	
	
	\item{There are no time or distance limits for a single ride}
	\item{The system stores all users' information}
	\item{The charging stations are into safe areas}
	\item{The data center can't be improperly modified or hacked}
	\item{If a vehicle is not usable the system suggest another reservation and charges the previous user for the reparation costs}
	\item{There are PowerEnJoy employees that move and re-charge out-of-service vehicles}

	\item{If an unlocked car is not ignited within three minutes the system starts to charge the user}
	\item{The system uses a reliable external payment system}
	\item{Bills are payed once}
	\item{There are precedence rules regarding the fee/discount application}	
	
\end{itemize}
