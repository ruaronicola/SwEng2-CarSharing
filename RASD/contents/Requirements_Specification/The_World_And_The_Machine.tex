For a first domain analysis of the PowerEnJoy application we use "The World \& The Machine" model by M. Jackson and P. Zave. 
\\This approach let us identify the entities inside the domain that interact with the application ("The World"), entities to be developed ("The Machine") and the intersection ("Shared Phenomena") between the world and the application, that are all world informations known or managed direclty by the application.
