\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The system must tag a car avaible again if it is not picked-up within an hour from the reservation.
  \item The system must apply a fee of 1 EUR if a car is not picked-up within an hour from the reservation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Mark needs to go to the city center in the late evening and decides to use a PowerEnJoy's car. Just before having a quick lunch in a near restaurant he browses the application and reserves car near him to make sure that it will still be available when he'll be back.
Unexpectedly Morgan, a friend of Mark, is lunching in the same restaurant and when they see each other they start chatting about everything and anything. When they stop talking Mark notices an e-mail from PowerEnJoy: it's about his reservation that has expired. His bank has also notified him that a fee of 1€ was applied by PowerEnJoy.
