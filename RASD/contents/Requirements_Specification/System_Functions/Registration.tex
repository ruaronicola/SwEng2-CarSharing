\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Mark has been told that a new awesome car-sharing service just launched, he then decide to download the mobile application and register as a new user. After filling the sign-up module a confirmation e-mail is sent to Mark containing his new credentials.


\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Susan was browsing the net when an advertisement caught her attention, it says: "PowerEnJoy is the new planet-friendly car sharing service! Register now and get a discount on your first ride!". She then clicks the advertisement and opens the web application: the first page is a Sign-up page and Susan fills up her personal informations and confirms. Unfortunately the informations provided are not complete and the system signals an error, she notices that the driving licence's informations are missing and compiles the remaining part of the module before submitting it and receiving a confirmation e-mail.
