\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
After five months that Susan is using PowerEnJoyshe she has decided that is better to change her \gls{pwd}. So she open her manage profile page and change it. Then she save the changes and the system upload Susan's information. Then for the future acesses Susan will use her new \gls{pwd}.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Mark is a typical PowerEnJoy user. Unfortunatly his credic card is expired and so he has to change it. He was using that credit card also for pay his PowerEnJoy's charges. So as soon as he has his new credit card he decides to upload his payment information on PowerEnJoy. He accesses his manage profile page and changed the payment information. Since that moment PowerEnJoy is going to charge Mark on his new credit card.
