Susan is a typical PowerEnJoy user, she was walking through a street when a friend texts her to hang out. Fortunately she saw a PowerEnJoy's car on the other side of the street. She reached the car and checked online: that's not available. Someone had probably already reserved it. But on the app she noticed that there were two avable car 5 minutes walk from her position. Then she reserved one of that two cars and easily reached it, thanks to the accurate location service provided by the system.
