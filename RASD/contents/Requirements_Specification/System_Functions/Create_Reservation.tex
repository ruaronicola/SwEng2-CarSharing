\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Mark needed to go to the city center and he decided to use a PowerEnJoy's car. He has checked online that there is an avaible car near his position but before to go he would have a quick lunch. He wanted to be sure than after his lunch the car would be still avaible so he decided to reserve the car.
Unexpectedly Morgan, a friend of Lucas, decided to go to have lunch in the same place of Mark. When they saw each other they were very happy and they started to chat about their jobs. When they finished to talk Mark notice that PowerEnJoy sent him an e-mail. The mail was about his reservation that expired due to the fact the the hour was finished. His bank has also notified him that a fee of 1€ was applied by PowerEnJoy.


\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Susan is a typical PowerEnJoy user, she was walking through a street when a friend texts her to hang out. Fortunately she saw a PowerEnJoy's car on the other side of the street. She reached the car and checked online: that's not available. Someone had probably already reserved it. But on the app she noticed that there were two avable car 5 minutes walk from her position. Than she reserved one of that two cars and easily reached it, thanks to the accurate location service provided by the system.
