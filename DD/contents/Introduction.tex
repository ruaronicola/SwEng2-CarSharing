\section{Document Structure}
\begin{description} 
	\item[Introduction: ] In this chapter an introduction to the system and the Design Document is given.
	\item[Architectural Design: ] In this section an overall description of the architecture is given, it is structured into 7 different parts: 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Overview: High-level components and their interaction
			\item Component view
			\item Deployment view
			\item Runtime view
			\item Component Interfaces
			\item Selected architectural styles and patterns
			\item Other design decisions
		\end{itemize}
	\item[Algorithm Design: ] In this chapter the implemented algorithms are discussed and presented using flow-charts and pseudo-code in order to ease the comprehension and focus on the functionality.
	\item[User Interface Design: ] In this section the main choices in User Interface and User Experience design are discussed.
	\item[Requirements Traceability: ] In this section a clear link between requirements specification (RASD) and design decisions (DD) is created.
