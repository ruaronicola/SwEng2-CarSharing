The hardware topology is described here, highlighting components and their relationships. The software parts are deployed in or-
der to have the system working.
\\As previously see in the Overview the system will run thanks of 4 main components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{The client device, where an User can interact with the system. There are different GUI that renders the web or mobile pages of our system, differentiating between On-board computer, mobile application and web application.}
	\item{ The Web Server is needed for those who are connected to the system with a computer. It establishes a secure internet connection through the HTTPS protocol.}
	\item{The Application Server is the core of our system. Here we have the Business Logic, where the whole system computation is
made.}
	\item{In the Database all the information of the system are stored. It's accessible only by the Application Server that store and take data from there.}
\end{itemize}
