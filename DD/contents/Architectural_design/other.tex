\subsection{Authentication}
	Our application exposes a RESTful API, this means that the server implementation is state-less. 
	\\A RESTful authentication and a true-stateless architecture are achieved using \textbf{Query Authentication}: 
	the log-in request generates an API token which is stored by the client and every request must be authenticated using the private token as the signing key.
