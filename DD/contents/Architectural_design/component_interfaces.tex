 PDO: PHP Data Objects used by the BLL to communicate with the DAL.
 	RESTful API with JSON used by clients ( both mobile apps and web
browsers ) to interact with the BLL. API calls that need authentication are
required to authenticate via HTTP basic authentication for each request. exchanged
data will be secured using SSL.
as now ( v1 ) our exposed methods are the following:
• api/v1/driver [auth]
– GET: get driver info
– PATCH/PUT: update driver data ( position and available status )
• api/v1/request
– POST: create a new request
• api/v1/reservation
– POST: create a new reservation
• api/v1/ride
– POST: create a new ride
