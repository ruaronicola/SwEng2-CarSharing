In our system there are three main interfaces: the first one between the Database and the Application server, the second one between the Application server and the Web server/Mobile application/On-Board application; finally the third interface is between the Web application and the Web server.

\subsection{Java Persistence API}
The Java Persistence API (JPA) is the interface that describes the management of relational data in PowerEnJoy. It is used by the Application server to directly communicate with the Database.
 	
\subsection{RESTful API}
A RESTful API is used by clients to interact with the Application server. A stateless architecture is achieved, in particular, using the JAX-RS API.

\subsection{HTTPS}
The web application interacts with the application server passing through the web server; it uses the HTTPS protocol enforced with a RESTful approach (Query Authentication is discussed in subsection 2.7.1).
