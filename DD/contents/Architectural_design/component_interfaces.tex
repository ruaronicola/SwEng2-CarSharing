In our system there are three main interfaces: the first one between the Database and the Application server, the second one between the Application server and the Web server, the Mobile application and the On-Board computer and finally the third interface is between the Web server and the Web application.

\subsection{Java Persistence API}
The Java Persistence API (JPA) is the interface that describes the management of relational data in PowerEnJoy. It is used by the Application server to communicate with the Database.
 	
\subsection{JAX-RS}
JAX-RS develops our Application server in order to use the REST architecture.

\subsection(RESTful API)
RESTful API are used by clients to interact with the Application server. REST specifies an uniform interface. A RESTful API explicitly takes advantage of HTTP methodologies defined by the RFC 2616 protocol so each call that need authentication is required to authenticate via HTTP basic authentication.
