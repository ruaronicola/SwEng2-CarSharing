HEY! Iâ€™M A REMINDER :) I AM HERE TO REMIND YOU THAT HERE YOU ASSUMED THAT: THE LOCATION WILL NOT STORE USER LOCATIONS, THE SAFE AREAS ARE REPRESENTED AS POLYGONS AND THE BEHAVIOURS WILL APPEAR IN THE RIDE TABLE AS A FOREIGN KEY. PLEASE INCLUDE MY ASSUMPTIONS IN THE PRECEDING DOCUMENTS BEFORE ERASING ME :)

-Check for consistency among documents (Gateway->Handler in DD)
-Check ambiguity (dictionary, assumpt.)
-Completion: defined for each input; no characteristics yet to be discussed
-Ridoundance/Un-Useful
-Location only in rasd


RASD
-Assumptions: auto non viene mai lasciata fuori dalle SafeArea (se viene lasciata fuori vi e' una multa e/o continua a caricare)
-MODIFICA ASSUMPTION:"If a car is left at more ..."+ controlla l'assumption subito dopo
-check sequence diagram with the DD (Jack)

DD
-Check model+router (spiega che tutte le interazioni con il DB attraversano il Model)(idem per il router)
-SafeArea da sistemare sotto allo schema ER
-Schema ER e nella descrizione sotto volendo gli ID vanno maiuscoli
