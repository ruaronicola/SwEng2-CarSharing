\subsubsection{[25] Unordered Class and Interface Declarations}
The JavaMailContainer class lacks documentation and uses the default constructor. 
The variables are correctly listed (static, public, protected, package, private) and followed by the class methods and the inner classes.


\subsubsection{[26] Incorrect Method Grouping}
Methods are correctly grouped by functionality.

\subsubsection{[27] Code Duplicates}
No duplicates, long methods, big classes and breaking encapsulation have been detected.
Moreover, coupling and cohesion are adequate.
