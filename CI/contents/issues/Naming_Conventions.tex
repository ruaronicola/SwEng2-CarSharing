\subsubsection{[1] Unmeaningful Names}
All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what the name suggests.
\subsubsection{[2] One-char variables}
If one-character variables are used, they are used only for temporary “throwaway” variables, such as those used in for loops.
\subsubsection{[3] Inconsistent Class Names}
Class names are nouns, in mixed case, with the first letter of each word in capitalized. Examples: class Raster; class ImageSprite;
\subsubsection{[4] Inconsistent Interface Names}
Interface names should be capitalized like classes.
\subsubsection{[5] Inconsistent Method Names}
Method names should be verbs, with the first letter of each addition word capitalized.\\
Examples: getBackground(); computeTemperature().
\subsubsection{[6] Inconsistent Attribute Names}
Class variables, also called attributes, are mixed case, but might begin with an underscore (‘ ’) followed by a lowercase first letter.\\
All the remaining words in the variable name have their first letter capitalized. Examples:   windowHeight, timeSeriesData.
\subsubsection{[7] Inconsistent Constants Names}
Constants are declared using all uppercase with words separated by an underscore. Examples: MIN\_WIDTH; MAX\_HEIGHT.
