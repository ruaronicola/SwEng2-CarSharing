\subsubsection{[1] Unmeaningful Names}
%All class names, interface names, method names, class variables, method variables, and constants used should have meaningful names and do what the name suggests.
\begin{description}
	\item[:100] The \textbf{cfg} variable can be renamed to \textbf{config}.
	\item[:124] The meaning \textbf{prop} variable is not immediate. Considering that it is used as a throwaway variable, though, this is acceptable.
	\item[:208] The meaning of the \textbf{props} argument is not immediate. Since it is used in an extended context and not as a throwaway variable, it should be named \textbf{properties}.
	\item[:241] Similarly to the previous item, the \textbf{portProps} variable should be named \textbf{portProperties} instead.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{[2] One-char variables}
\begin{description}
	\item[:114, :178, :188, :201, :246, :255, :305, :312, :385] The variable \textbf{e} is correctly used as a throwaway variable for Exceptions.
	\item[:166] The variable \textbf{p} is correctly used as a throwaway variable to loop through the \textbf{Property} attribute.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{[3] Inconsistent Class Names}
There are no inconsistent or improperly capitalized class names.

\subsubsection{[4] Inconsistent Interface Names}
There are no inconsistent or improperly capitalized interface names.

\subsubsection{[5] Inconsistent Method Names}
\begin{description}
	\item[:208] The method \textbf{updateUrlName} is correctly capitalized according to the capitalization conventions. To integrate consistently with the rest of this project, though, this method should be named \textbf{updateURLName}.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{[6] Inconsistent Attribute Names}
%Class variables, also called attributes, are mixed case, but might begin with an underscore (‘ ’) followed by a lowercase first letter.\\
%All the remaining words in the variable name have their first letter capitalized. Examples:   windowHeight, timeSeriesData.
There are no inconsistent or improperly capitalized attribute names.

\subsubsection{[7] Inconsistent Constants Names}
%Constants are declared using all uppercase with words separated by an underscore. Examples: MIN\_WIDTH; MAX\_HEIGHT.
\begin{description}
	\item[:61] The static variable \textbf{module} should be named \textbf{MODULE}, using uppercase letters.
\end{description}
