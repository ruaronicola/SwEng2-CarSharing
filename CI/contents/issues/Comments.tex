\subsubsection{[18] Inadequate Comments}
Comments are used only in a few key-situations. Only before three methods there is a description and only a variable has an explanation. The lack of comments can compromise the understanding of the program by new users, so it is recommended to add some comments.

\subsubsection{[19] Commented code}
There isn't commented out code.
