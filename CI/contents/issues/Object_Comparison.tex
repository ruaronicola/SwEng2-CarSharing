\subsubsection{[40] Incorrect Object Comparation}
\begin{description}
	\item[:193] \textbf{store} and \textbf{null} are compared with "==". This is correct, though, as reference are being compared and not objects.  
	\item[:250] \textbf{portProps} and \textbf{0} are compared with "==". This is correct, though, as \textbf{portProps} is of primitive type \textbf{int}. Eventually the variable could be declared as \textbf{Integer}.
	\item[:338] \textbf{totalMessages} and \textbf{0} are compared with "==". This is correct, though, as \textbf{totalMessages} is of primitive type \textbf{int}. Eventually the variable could be declared as \textbf{Integer}.
