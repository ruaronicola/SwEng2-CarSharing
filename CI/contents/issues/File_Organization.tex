\subsubsection{[12] Unseparated Sections}
Blank lines and optional comments are used to separate sections. For example, blank lines are used for divide different kind of variables.
%(beginning comments, package/import statements, class/interface declarations which include class variable/attributes declarations, constructors, and methods).

\subsubsection{[13] Exceeded 80char Line Lenght}
In the program many lines exceed 80char. Maybe these lines should be split, this solution is applicable in most of the cases.
\subsubsection{[14] Exceeded 120char Line Lenght}
In the program there are a few lines that exceed also 120char. The longest line is 178char. This lines must be divided in order to make them more practical.
