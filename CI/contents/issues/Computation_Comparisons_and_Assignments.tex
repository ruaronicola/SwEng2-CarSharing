\subsubsection{[46] Incorrect use of Parenthesis}
%Check the liberal use of parenthesis is used to avoid operator precedence problems.
No computation/evaluation is present in the code.

\subsubsection{[47] Division by Zero}

No computation/evaluation is present in the code.

\subsubsection{[48] Inappropriate Integer Arithmetic}
%Check that integer arithmetic, especially division, are used appropriately to avoid causing unexpected truncation/rounding.
No computation/evaluation is present in the code.

\subsubsection{[49] Incorrect Boolean Comparison}
%Check that the comparison and Boolean operators are correct.
%\begin{description}\item[:103, :127, :134, :165, :183, :193, :250, :261, :299, :338, :356, :368 ] \end{description}
