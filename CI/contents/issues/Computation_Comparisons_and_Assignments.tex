\subsubsection{[44] "Brutish" Programming}
Check that the implementation avoids “brutish programming”
(see http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/CodeSmells/bonehead. html).
\subsubsection{[45] Incorrect Operator Precedence and Parenthesizing}
Check order of computation/evaluation, operator precedence and parenthesizing.
\subsubsection{[46] Incorrect use of Parenthesis}
Check the liberal use of parenthesis is used to avoid operator precedence problems.
\subsubsection{[47] Division by Zero}
Check that all denominators of a division are prevented from being zero.
\subsubsection{[48] Inappropriate Integer Arithmetic}
Check that integer arithmetic, especially division, are used appropriately to avoid causing unexpected truncation/rounding.
\subsubsection{[49] Incorrect Boolean Comparison}
Check that the comparison and Boolean operators are correct.
\subsubsection{[50] Inconsistent throw-catch}
Check throw-catch expressions, and check that the error condition is actually legitimate.
\subsubsection{[51] Implicit Type Comversion}
Check that the code is free of any implicit type conversions.
